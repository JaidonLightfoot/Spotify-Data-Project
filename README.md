# Spotify Track Popularity Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global Spotify track data to explore trends in music popularity, artist performance, and release patterns over time. The workflow includes data cleaning in SQL, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualizations built in Tableau.

## Tools Used
- MySQL (Data cleaning, transformation, analysis)
- Excel (Initial inspection and validation)
- Tableau (Dashboards & visual storytelling)

## Business Questions
- How is track popularity distributed across decades?
- Which artists consistently produce high-performing tracks?
- Do artists with more tracks tend to have higher average popularity?
- How does album type relate to popularity trends?

## Project Workflow
1. Raw dataset validation in Excel
2. SQL data cleaning and transformation (`tracks_clean` table)
3. Exploratory queries and aggregations
4. Tableau dashboard creation and insight reporting

## Key Insights
- Medium-popularity tracks dominate across modern decades, suggesting broader listener distribution.
- The 2010s show the highest volume of high-performing tracks.
- Some artists achieve higher “hit rates” despite releasing fewer total tracks.
